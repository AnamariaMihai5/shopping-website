# Shopping website - Cart functionality


Shopping website made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The navigation bar was made using Bootstrap.

The project mainly focuses on cart functionality: adding products to the cart, verifying if the product is already in the cart, 
removing certain items, updating the price and resetting the cart, price and quantity once an order is placed.

The design is responsive, adapting well to all screens.
